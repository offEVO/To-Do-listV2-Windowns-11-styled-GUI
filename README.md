# This is Version 2 of my "To - Do" list application using PyQt5 to create a windows 11 (dark themed) To do list application

The setup of my Code is simmular to the previous version of my code.

                                                               SETUP
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This code is a To-Do list that remembers everything previously saved and stores it as a file, for you to be able to edit in the to-do list application.

In the main code file, you will see the code required for the application to work. It's pretty straightforward from there, but there is one thing you WILL NEED:


You must make a "tasks" spelled like this. This text document must be in the same file directory as the code. This is so it can access the file and save the previously stored information.

We can use the python installer "PIP" to install the necessary library's

From there all you should need to do is past the code in to the code editor of choice:

_________________________________________________
A feature I thought about adding was bullet points, I believe this helps the tasks 
feel more individual and stop them blending into a paragraph ↓
