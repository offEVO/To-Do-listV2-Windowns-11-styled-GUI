Greetings! In relation to the utilization of my GitHub project, I have implemented a licensing mechanism,
such as the MIT License, within the repository. This license grants individuals the freedom to employ,
modify, and distribute the code, If you want to use my code for commercial use, please let me know at
"nelsonbazzard@gmail.com" and we can discuss that matter in greater detail for commercial purposes.
It's important to note that enforcing stringent behavioral guidelines can pose challenges,
particularly given the public nature of the repository. While I lack the means to
prohibit usage, I trust that users will adhere to the stipulated terms.
However, as a newer member of the coding community, I acknowledge the
complexity of legal matters. For comprehensive guidance or
in the face of significant concerns, consulting with a
legal professional or seeking advice from a trusted
source is recommended. Thank you for your understanding.
